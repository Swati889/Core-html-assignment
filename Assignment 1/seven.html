           <ul>
           <li> Programming is the art of algorithm design and the craft of debugging errant code</li>
           <li> Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, itâ€™s bad</li>
           <li> Make it work, make it right, make it fast</li>
           <li> First, solve the problem. Then, write the code</li>
           <li> When I wrote this code, only God and I understood what I did. Now only God knows</li>
           </ul>
